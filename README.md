# Introduction
A fully functional task management web app, where users can have multiple boards, and each task can have multiple subtasks. also users are able to drag and drop tasks either vertically to change their priority, or horizontally to change their status.
Made using T3 stack( NextJS, TRPC, tailwind, prisma, next Auth) and dnd-kit.

# Getting Started

Follow the steps below:

## ‚è≥ Installation

First, install all required dependencies :
```
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file inside the `/` folder having the following structure:
```env
DATABASE_URL=

NEXTAUTH_SECRET
NEXTAUTH_URL = http://localhost:3000 # or the link to your website

# Next Auth Discord Provider
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=

# Next Auth Google Provider
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=


# Next Auth Github Provider
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=
```

If you want to remove or add auth providers, you have to modify the following files :
`/src/env/schema.mjs` and `/src/pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts`.
